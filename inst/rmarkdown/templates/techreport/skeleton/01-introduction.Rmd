# INTRODUCTION

Introduction is not mandatory, but when available, it begins on page 1.

# OTHER HEADINGS AS APPROPRIATE

Research Documents explain technical information and data to support the advice. Other headings may include Methods, Results, and Discussion. These headings are optional and context dependent.

## Lists

CSAS allows ordered lists:

::: {custom-style="List Number"}

1. Item 1

1. Item 2

:::

and bulleted lists:

::: {custom-style="List Bullet"}

- Item 1

- Item 2

:::


Note that you *must* have blank lines between the list elements for the proper CSAS styles to be applied. Sub-list items are not supported (you would have to manually apply the List Number 2 or List Bullet 2 style after).

This is a reference to a figure: Figure \@ref(fig:example-fig).

This is a reference to a supplemental figure: Figure \@ref(fig:fig-biology-example).

This is a reference to a table: Table \@ref(tab:example-table).

This is a reference to a supplemental table: Table \@ref(tab:tab-model-parameters).

This is a reference to an equation: Equation \@ref(eq:example-eq).

This is a reference to a section: Section \@ref(sec:math).

This is a reference to an appendix: Appendix \@ref(app:biology). And the other appendix: Appendix \@ref(app:additional).

## Tables

```{r example-table, tab.cap = "Table showing random numbers."}
set.seed(1)
df1 <- data.frame(Year = 1:10, Index = round(rlnorm(10), 2))
flextable(df1) |> 
  set_table_properties(layout = "autofit") |>
  set_caption(caption = "My caption.")
```

## Figures

```{r example-fig, fig.cap = "Figure showing random numbers."}
df2 <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10))
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() + theme_light()
```

This version has an output width that differs from the one set in the opening `opts_chunk$set()` call in index.Rmd. I have also demonstrated reducing the default internal `fig.width` here so the text isn't too small after scaling the output width.

```{r example-fig2, fig.cap = "Figure showing random numbers.", fig.width=4, out.width="60%"}
df2 <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10))
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() + theme_light()
```

## Math {#sec:math}

You can include most valid LaTeX math:

\begin{equation}
  1 + 1 = 2
  (\#eq:example-eq)
\end{equation}

## Bibliographies

Here's a reference: [@francis2011]. This `francis2011` entry appears in a file called `refs.bib` in the `bib` folder. This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file). Another example: @edwards2013 shows that. And another example: [e.g., @francis2011; @edwards2013; @swainbenoit2015].

**Tips for Bibliographies**

::: {custom-style="List Bullet"}

- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.

- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.

- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capitalized word in curly braces. E.g. `{Pacific Cod}`.

:::

CSAS style requires the bibliography to be before the appendices and before tables and figures if you keep those together at the end of your document.
