# CONTEXT

<!-- Mandatory section and title. -->

<!-- An example of how to include text based on the language. The two chunks below shows how switching the toggle in the YAML header for french allows inclusion/rejection of a paragraph. -->

```{r para-chap01-1-en, eval = !fr(), results = 'asis'}
cat("The context section must give the readers a clear idea of the issue being addressed and of the history of how the need for this process came about (e.g., the rationale for using the Science Response Process in this specific case).
    
To create a fully french document, you need a chunk like this one for each paragraph or full section of text.")
```
```{r para-chap01-1-fr, eval = fr(), results = 'asis', needs_trans = FALSE}
cat("(This is where you place the French translation of the paragraph. Once you do, set needs_trans to FALSE in the chunk header) La section sur le contexte doit donner aux lecteurs une idée claire de la question traitée et de l'historique de la nécessité de ce processus (par exemple, la justification de l'utilisation du processus d'intervention scientifique dans ce cas précis).")
```

<!-- It should include the formal request/question from the client, the response deadline, as well as a short summary of the conclusion (one or two sentences).

The rationale for the approach taken to answer the request can be described (e.g., specific scientific questions that were addressed).
This section could also include information on previous related meetings and advice on which this process is based.

This section is not intended for detailed background information on the science issues themselves, but rather gives the bigger picture.
At the end of this section, the reader will have a clear understanding of the reason to produce the report, will know how this specific report fits in the sequence of past advice, and what advice is expected to be produced in the future on this specific issue.

If the objective of the process was to comment on a specific report (e.g., Environmental Assessment report produced by a proponent in the context of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act) then the relevant link to the report that was the subject of the review could be identified in this section.

This section will be posted in HTML format on the CSAS website followed by the link to the full PDF version of the publication. -->

<!-- *The meeting date and title must be exactly as they appear on the Fisheries and Oceans Science Advisory Schedule. -->
