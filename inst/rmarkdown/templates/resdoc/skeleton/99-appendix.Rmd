# APPENDIX `r new_appendix()`. BIOLOGICAL DATA {#app:biology}

This appendix demonstrates appendix-specific figure and table numbering (A.1, A.2, etc.).

## Sample Biological Data

```{r fig-biology-example, fig.cap="Example plot."}
set.seed(123)
length_data <- data.frame(
  length_cm = rnorm(100, mean = 45, sd = 10),
  weight_kg = rnorm(100, mean = 2.5, sd = 0.8)
)
plot(length_data$length_cm, length_data$weight_kg,
  xlab = "Length (cm)", ylab = "Weight (kg)",
  pch = 16, col = rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5)
)
```

You can also create tables with appendix numbering:

```{r tab-biology-summary, tab.cap="Summary statistics."}
summary_table <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c("Mean Length", "SD Length", "Mean Weight", "SD Weight"),
  Value = c(
    round(mean(length_data$length_cm), 2),
    round(sd(length_data$length_cm), 2),
    round(mean(length_data$weight_kg), 2),
    round(sd(length_data$weight_kg), 2)
  )
)
flextable::flextable(summary_table)
```

## Subsection Example

You can have subsections within appendices as usual. The figure numbering continues within the same appendix (A.1, A.2, A.3...).

```{r fig-biology-histogram, fig.cap="Length frequency distribution"}
hist(length_data$length_cm,
  main = "",
  xlab = "Length (cm)",
  col = "lightblue",
  border = "white"
)
```
