# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the R Markdown CSAS template.

# R MARKDOWN BASICS {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using *R Markdown*. *Markdown* is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. *R Markdown* provides the flexibility of *Markdown* with the implementation of **R** input and output. For more details on using *R Markdown* see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Be careful with your spacing in *Markdown* documents. While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give *Markdown* signals as to how to proceed. As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph. In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

## LISTS

CSAS allows ordered lists:

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

and bulleted lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2

Notice in the ordered list that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4. *Markdown* automatically figures this out! You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list. Check it out below.

To create sublists, just indent the values a bit (at least three spaces) and make sure there are no newlines between the items. (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   a. Item 3a
   a. Item 3b
      i. Item 3bi
      i. Item 3bii
      i. Item 3biii
      i. Item 3biv
      i. Item 3bv
         1. Item 3bv1
         1. Item 3bv2

## LINE BREAKS

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph. Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence. Here is another sentence. Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:*

Here is the first sentence. Here is another sentence. Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R CHUNKS

When you click the **Knit** button above a document in RStudio (or run `csasdown::render()` in the R console within the working directory that has your `index.Rmd` file) output will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## INLINE CODE

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`.

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.

## INCLUDING PLOTS

You can also embed plots. For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot. There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options. More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.

Another useful chunk option is the setting of `cache=TRUE` as you see here. If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations or plots that are expensive to generate you can use knitr caching to improve performance. Later in this file, you'll see a way to reference plots created in **R** or external figures.

## LOADING AND EXPLORING DATA

Included in this template is a file called `flights.csv`. This file includes a subset of the larger dataset of information about all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014. More information about this dataset and its **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>. This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values. Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

We can load in this data set using the following command (`read_csv()` is from the package `readr`):
```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
flights <- read_csv(file.path("data", "flights.csv"))
``` 

All your tabular data should be in `.csv` files and placed in the `data` directory. The function `here::here()` should always be used when loading data into the project because it will prepend the full root directory of the project onto the directories and files inside the call. This gives consistent file structure access across multiple machines and platforms.

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**. To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions. Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.

```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form. With this dataset having more than 50,000 rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command here. I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have run the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**. To do that, you can use the command `View(flights)`.

A simple and effective way to see the entire structure in one call is to use the `glimpse()` command like this:
```{r glimpse_flights, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed. It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations. Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information about the Portland flights in 2014. You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful, high-quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

The example we show here does the following:

- Selects only the `carrier_name` and `arr_delay` from the `flights` dataset and then assigns this subset to a new variable called `flights2`.

- Using `flights2`, we determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

```{r max_delays}
library(dplyr)
flights2 <- flights |> 
  select(carrier_name, arr_delay)
max_delays <- flights2 |> 
  group_by(carrier_name) |> 
  summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

A useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in _R Markdown_ is called `kable`. It is much easier to use than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting values into Excel or LaTeX. This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be! (Note the use of `results="asis"`, which will produce the table instead of the code to create the table.) The `caption.short` argument is used to include a shorter title to appear in the List of Tables.

Within CSAS you should use the function `csasdown::csas_table()` instead. It just calls the function `kable()`, but it adds some default argument values that will make the tables render correctly in both LaTeX and in Word documents.

```{r maxdelays, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
csas_table(max_delays,
  col.names = c("Airline", "Max Arrival Delay"),
  caption = "Maximum Delays by Airline"
)
```

Let's make a plot of the data:

```{r march3plot, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=4, fig.cap="My caption."}
library(ggplot2)
flights |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```
