## ASSESSMENT

[Standard figure, if applicable, comes first -- example shown. All figures and tables should be referenced in the text. Refer to the Guidance Document for exceptions, options and further instructions.]

![Figure 1: (ref:caption)](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="4.013194444444444in"}

Figure 1. (A -- upper left panel) Catch and Total Allowable Catch, (B -- upper right panel) Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) in relation to the Limit Reference Point (LRP; X) and (proposed) Upper Stock Reference (USR; X), (C -- bottom left panel) Fishing Mortality (F; X) on the left in relation to the Removal Reference (RR) and Natural Mortality (M), (D- bottom right panel) Recruitment (numbers).

[Optional. Add an additional optional panel of 4 indicators if relevant to developing advice.]

[Optional. If the FSAR or FSRR is being used to provide advice for more than one stock or subunit, the mandatory and optional panels can be repeated for each stock or subunit.]

### Stock Status and Trends 

[Mandatory. Maximum section length one page. Must be first section in Assessment section. If needed, this section can be duplicated for each stock or subunit, although it may be preferable to maintain one section in which all stocks and subunits are described.]

[Provide information on stock status and all the key indicators for the stock(s) relevant to decision-making, over timescales relevant to the stock. Tables can be used if helpful for decision-making. Cite mandatory and optional figures and tables in the text as needed. Report trends in relevant indicator(s), one per paragraph, in the following format:]

#### **[Indicator 1]** [specify name, e.g., Abundance] 

[Provide values and trends for the stock (as applicable). Use as many indicators as relevant to providing advice for decision-making.]

#### **Current** Status

[Mandatory. Indicate stock status relative to its reference point(s) or state status is unknown if there are no reference points.]

#### Unknown

[Optional. Indicate what indicators are not available for the stock (as applicable); otherwise, do not include.]

### History of [Management; Landings/Harvest/Effort, TAC & Catch Advice]

[Mandatory. Title can vary. Maximum section length one page. Similar to Stock Status and Trends, the purpose of this section is to provide information on past and present key indicator(s) and reference level(s) of harvest, hatchery or habitat management that are relevant to decision-making, over timescales relevant to the stock.]

### Stock Advice [optional titles: Projections, Simulations, Future Scenarios]

[Mandatory. Title can vary. Sub-headings may be used. The purpose of this section is to provide forward-looking science advice on the prospects for the stock to Fisheries Management, usually in the context of current or proposed future range of harvest levels, harvest decision rules, or other management measures, procedures or scenarios that may be considered by decision-makers. There is no length limit to this section, however the overall document length guidance still applies. Tables or figures can be used as needed to support decision-making.]

### Harvest Decision Rule

[If applicable (otherwise, do not include).To provide information needed to apply an established Harvest Decision Rule for the stock.]

### Exceptional Circumstances

[If applicable (otherwise, do not include). Proposal for or evaluation of any already-established exceptional circumstances that may indicate a need for re-evaluation of management procedures in an MSE context.]

## **PROCEDURE FOR INTERIM-YEAR UPDATES** 

[Optional (otherwise, do not include). If a process for interim-year updates (DFO 2016) is being set for the first time in this meeting, or an established one exists for the stock, describe it briefly in this section.]

### Evaluation of Assessment Triggers

[If applicable (otherwise, do not include). Applicable during Interim-Year Updates. Evaluation of any triggers that would prompt a stock assessment sooner than the pre-agreed cycle.]

## BYCATCH

[Optional (otherwise, do not include). Estimates of bycatch of non-target species. If the target species that is the focus of this assessment is caught in other fisheries, that information should be summarized in the landings portion of the assessment.]

## OTHER MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS

[Optional (otherwise, do not include). If there is another management question(s) to be addressed during a full assessment, such as other types of management or rebuilding measures, advice on candidate reference points or measurable objectives requested by Fisheries Management, or advice in relation to other Sustainable Fisheries Framework policies, a brief summary of the evaluation can be placed here. Content should be relevant for decision making, and corresponding summary bullets can then also be added to the Science Advice section under the optional Other Management Questions heading. Tables or figures may be used, if relevant for advice.]

## SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY

[Mandatory. Less than 500 words. To identify and explain key uncertainties, including assumptions, that may impact the advice, in order to avoid misinterpretation of advice presented in the sections above.]
