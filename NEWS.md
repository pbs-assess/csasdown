  disable "Continued..." text on long tables that span multiple pages.

# csasdown 0.1.3

* Add `on.exit()` to `csasdown::render()` to avoid leaving behind `tmp-` files
  if an R error is encountered.
  
* Fix `csasdown::render()` render environment.

# csasdown 0.1.2

* The Science Response template now uses `french_title` instead of `title_other`
  for consistency with other formats and should be built with 
  `csasdown::render()`. #241

* Add option `create_rstudio_file` in `draft()` to avoid creating an RStudio 
  project file. Stop creating a `.here` file. #243

# csasdown 0.1.0

* All messages, warnings, and errors now appear in color if your console supports ANSI color escapes. RStudio does support this and all testing for this feature was done in RStudio 2022.02.3 Build 492.

* `verbose` was added to many functions. If you run `render(verbose = TRUE)` you will see a detailed listing of the steps taken during rendering, including line numbers of important items.

* A new function `csasdown::render()` will auto-detect your document type (*4resdoc*, *resdoc-b*, *sr*, *techreport*) and render accordingly. We recommend using this over `bookdown::render_book()`. The 'Knit' button in RStudio should properly choose `csasdown::render()`.

* New YAML options are required for this render method; an error will be produced when you run `render()` explaining which ones you are missing. These new YAML options are new French options and are required to render the document. Even if you don't plan on using French, you must enter them with some (any) default text. They are:
   - `french_month`
   - `french_region`
   - `french_address`
   - `french_title`
   - `french_abstract`
   
* The four example documents (*resdoc*, *resdoc-b*, *sr*, *techreport*) contain all the current YAML options.

* There is a new example document called **resdoc-b** which you can get by running `csasdown::draft("resdoc-b")` and then rendering with `csasdown::render()`. That document is built with and explains all the new features and the new `render()` function.

* If you're using an old version of **index.Rmd** in your project you should modify the `knit:` YAML tag to the following:
  ```
  knit: (function(input, ...) {
        csasdown::render('_bookdown.yml')`
        })
  ```
* If you're using an old version of **index.Rmd** in your project you should delete these chunks of code from it:
  ```
  meta <- rmarkdown::metadata$output
  if (length(grep("pdf", names(meta)))) {
    french <- meta$`csasdown::resdoc_pdf`$french
    prepub <- meta$`csasdown::resdoc_pdf`$prepub
  } else if (length(grep("word", names(meta)))) {
    french <- meta$`csasdown::resdoc_word`$french
    prepub <- meta$`csasdown::resdoc_word`$prepub
  }
  csl <- "csl/csas.csl"
  if (french) {
    csl <- "csl/csas-french.csl"
    options(OutDec = ",")
  }
  ```
  and
  ```
  ---
  csl: `r csl`    
  ---
  ```
