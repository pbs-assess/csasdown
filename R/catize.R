#' Convert a string including inline knitr code chunks to a cat-like string
#'
#' @description
#' Formats the supplied string so that inline knitr code chunks are replaced
#' with the format used in commands such as [cat()] and [paste()] which is a
#' series of comma-separated strings and R code. Use this function to format
#' strings from Rmarkdown to something that can be copy/pasted into a [cat()]
#' command inside a knitr chunk.
#'
#' @details
#' This is used primarily to convert sections of code that have been written
#' in Rmarkdown into simple strings with R code embedded between quoted,
#' comma-separated strings that can be passed to [cat()]. Here is a simple
#' example of the conversion this function does.
#'
#' Original rmarkdown string:
#'
#' ```
#' "The date is `r as.character(Sys.Date())` today. You are on
#' a `r Sys.info()["sysname"]` machine."
#' ```
#'
#' Modified cat-like string (can be passed to [cat()]):
#'
#' ```
#' "The date is ", as.character(Sys.Date()), " today. You are on a ",
#' Sys.info()["sysname"], " machine."
#' ```
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @param str The string containing inline knitr-style R code
#' (backtick-enclosed)
#'
#' @return A non-quoted (see [noquote()]) string which can be
#' enclosed with double-quotes and copy/pasted into a [cat()]
#' or [paste()] command
#'
#' @importFrom stringr str_split str_extract_all
#' @importFrom knitr all_patterns
